Today, I have been isekai'd as a turtle statue and it was such an exhilarating experience that I was taken as a pet from my owner Michelle the filipino, they loved me so much that they knit me a tiny scarf and a tiny hat so I can be as stylish as I want.
I don't know what the heck is  going on...
I am a turtle goat, please respect me.
